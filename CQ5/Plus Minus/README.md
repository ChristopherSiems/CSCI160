# Complexity

## Time Complexity

$\mathcal{O}(n)$. The algorithm iterates over the whole list one time and all other operations take constant time. Therefore the runtime of this algorithm is linearly related to the input size of the List.

## Space Complexity

$\mathcal{O}(1)$. The algorithm creates a constant number of auxiliary variables to store information. The number of variables is not dependent on the size of the input, so it is constant.
