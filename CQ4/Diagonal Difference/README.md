## Time Complexity

$\cal{O}(n)$. My algorithm iterates with one for-loop one time from the top of the matrix to the bottom of the matrix, doing constant time operations only during each iteration of the for-loop. With $n$ being the dimension of the square matrix, the runtime of my algorithm is $\cal{O}(n)$.

## Space Complexity

$\cal{O}(1)$. My algorithm uses a constant number of constant size auxiliary variables, two sum tracker integers and 3 loop iterators. Because the space required by the algorithm does not grow with input size, the space complexity of my algorithm is $\cal{O}(1)$.
