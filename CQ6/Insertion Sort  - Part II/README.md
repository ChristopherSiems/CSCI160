# Complexity

## Time Complexity

$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. The algorithm in its worst case will perform $2n$ constant time operations inside the first for-loop due to the two for-loops nested inside the first. Because we use $\mathcal{O}$ notation, that coefficient is dropped and the complexity simplifies to $n^2$.

## Space Complexty

$\mathcal{O}(1)$. The algorithm uses a constant number of constant size variables to find it's answer.
