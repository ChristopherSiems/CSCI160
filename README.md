# CSCI 160 Coding Quizzes

 Repo for CSCI 160 coding quizzes

## Structure

 Each coding quiz has its own folder containing folders for each problem in the quiz. These sub folders contain a `.java` and `.txt` file with the solution code, a screenshot of the passed _HackerRank_ test cases, and some of the subfolders contain README documents explaining the complexity of the algorithms.
